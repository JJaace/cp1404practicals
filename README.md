## About this repository

This repository is to store all my IT@JCU CP1404 work from weeks 1 - 10
<br>Fun fact - I like basketball and sleep :)

## What I've learned about "clean code"

- Makes reading code easier for both myself and someone else doing a code review
- Is more professional
- Spends less time looking for bugs
