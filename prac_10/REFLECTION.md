## Estimates
I found that most of my estimates was pretty accurate with it taking more or less 20-30 minutes to complete the task with the exception of me taking 1+ hours on some tasks. During the course, I found that I haven't improved at all or very little at making estimates as I still find my self completing tasks which still takes me 30 minutes longer or less.
## Code Reviews
I liked code reviews as I often make simple mistakes such as missing estimates/actual times and missing docstrings. These simple mistakes went on about 1-2 weeks which could have costed me some marks but thankfully the other students kept reminding me which eventually made me be more aware of the little details. On the other hand, me reviewing codes made me realise that other students have different ways on how they approach the problem and I often take notes on how they tackle certain problems.
## Practical tasks
Regarding the weekly practical tasks. I found it helpful because when you just read/listen to the powerpoints/lectures, it is very easy to forget what you just learnt the next day, But having to do tasks on what you just learnt helps make you memorise on what you just learnt. One suggestion that I would appreciate and maybe other students as well, is that during assignments, if we could get an extra day or two to complete the practials. An example is that this week was extremely busy for me as I allocated all my time on Assignment 2 and didn't have much time to complete this week's practical
